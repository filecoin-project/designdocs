### Contributing to this repo
We play fast and loose in this here `designdocs` repo, but not recklessly.
- If you are adding new content, committers can commit directly.
- If you are editing or refactoring existing content, get 1 reviewer (preferably the original author, but others if they're not available). If they don't reply in 3 days with reasonable reminding efforts, committers can commit directly.
